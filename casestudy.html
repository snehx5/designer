<h1 id="title">Mirror UX Case Study</h1>
<p id="text"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Background</span><br>
  Mirror is a clothing store that carries clothing for all age groups. It has
clothes similar to Old Navy and H and M, and has been selling clothes for a
while without an online store. Now, it is going online, and requires a
modern new web design for its website.</p>

<h3 id="deliverable-heading">Competitor Analysis</h3>
<p>Competitor Analysis shows strengths and weaknesses of Mirror's competitors, and starts building
  user personas.</p>
<img src="competitor_analysis.png" class="img-responsive"/>
<ul><h3 id="deliverable-heading">Research Goals</h3>
  <li>a. Define the advantages of having an Online Store for Mirror</li><br>
  <li>b. Determine Mirror’s shoppers’ demographics, including their age and gender.</li><br>
  <li>c. Determine what users like about the Mirror brand. Determine what they most identify with it.</li><br>
  <li>d. Determine the most popular items Mirror sells every season.</li><br>
  <li>e. Determine what, if anything, users find convenient about online shopping.</li>
</ul>

<div style="width:75%;margin-left:0px;margin-top:250px;">
<h3 style="color:white;">Research Overview</h3>
<p>To gain insight about user’s online shopping experience, I have
interviewed participants that are all female and one is male. All
participants are (25-35), (35-55), and are working professionals or
students. The interviews explore online shopping to see what users find
positive and negative about these experiences, to gain a better
understanding of what is important to users.
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="deliverable-heading">Research Opportunities</h3>
<p>Build a website that has solid copy on the landing page, and item
descriptions that attract users searching for clothes online. The site
shows ads, photos of a variety of clothes that are stylish, and of good
quality. Website should take inspiration from JCPenney, HM, and
Amazon, stores which the users all like. Also, the website will have
some sales and coupons that are not applicable in store. The UI is clean
and efficiently moves the user through to the the shopping section
where they can browse many clothes, and filter these based on size, and
other option filters. There will be a section explaining the clothing
stores system of measurements so that the user can check what size he
or she is. The user can return clothes easily, like Amazon. Overall the
site design is good, and saves the user time, gives them many clothing
options, and makes them feel smart about their money.

    Development</h3>
    <p>These are exercises that work on building the persona and product
      requirements, based on my research.</p>

<h3 id="deliverable-heading">Card Sorting</h3>
<p>The Card Sorting exercise gives users a test to see how they would sort
  the categories, and sections of my site.</p>

<h3 id="deliverable-heading">Wireframes and First Draft of Responsive Prototypes</h3>
<p>Below are the my wireframes and initial responsive prototypes.  These both helped
me lay the foundation for the eventual outcome.  Certain sections were based on my research,
persona development, and understanding of the site flow.</p>

<img style="margin-top:15px;" src="responsive_prototypes.jpg" class="img-responsive">

<h3 id="deliverable-heading">Brand Logo, Style Tile and UI Kit</h3>
<p>These are elements of the user interface design.  The design choices for these
  elements are based on trying best to encapsulate the Mirror brand, from
  what was learned in the intial project brief and research.</p>

<h3 id="deliverable-heading">Usability Testing Objectives</h3>
<p>Once I had completed a prototype in Invision, I had to test it on users to check
  how effective, and usable it was.</p>
  <ol style="color:white;margin-top:0px;"><h4>Test Objectives<h4>
  <li>User can easily navigate through the website.</li><br>
  <li>User can select an item in a particular size.</li><br>
  <li>User can favorite an item.</li><br>
  <li>User can increase or decrease the quantity of an item.</li><br>
  <li>User can checkout an order successfully.</li>
  </ol>

  <img style="margin-top:25px;" src="usabilitytest.jpg" class="img-responsive">

  <h3 id="deliverable-heading">Affinity Map</h3>
  <p>The affinity map takes the research from my usability testing and organizes
    it, so I know how to improve my prototype.</p>
    <img src="affinitymap.png" class="img-responsive">

  <h3 id="deliverable-heading">Next Steps.</h3>
  <p style="width:75%;">The conclusions from my usability testing and affinity map provide me
    with a good idea of how to continue improving my prototype.
    At this point, my next steps are to "Make changes to prototype from research feedback. Add a drop-down navigation to the landing page, and change the call-to-action button to the accent color, green."</p>
